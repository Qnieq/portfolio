    "home.workHistory.mervice.text2": "Website for mervice.\n\nI fully developed the frontend using React. The main challenges I faced were implementing scroll animations by slides across devices and adding news, particularly uploading photos. I fixed the scrolling issue by adding a delay and ignoring redundant scroll events, and resolved the photo upload issue using formdata.\n\nBackend was new to me, and understanding how to handle requests and responses was the hardest part. I got acquainted with Express.js and implemented endpoints for the admin panel, which also involved file handling challenges.",
    "home.workHistory.mervice.text3": "I learned about Next.js and ISR, Sass, RTK Query, and TypeScript.\nOn the backend, I explored Express.js (routing, database interactions, endpoint and service creation).\n\nI gained experience working with Git in a team.\n\nI discovered Firebase, and the main challenge was storing files in the storage. It took me many hours to understand how to configure everything correctly, send files, and retrieve them.\n\nThe hardest part was learning and understanding backend principles.",
    "home.workHistory.mervice.text4": "Training Platform.\n\nOn the frontend, I implemented all the logic for quizzes and user statistics. I extensively worked with Redux Toolkit while developing quizzes. The only problem I encountered was with statistics: data often came incorrectly from other modules handled by developers in different time zones, making collaboration difficult. For displaying statistics, I used charts, which turned out to be surprisingly straightforward.",

    "home.workHistory.TaskSync.text3": "Frontend: Fully implemented a drag-and-drop system for the 'kanban' board and time blocks. I learned about interceptors in Axios for JWT (token validation, refreshing, and attaching tokens in bearer headers) for backend requests.\n\nBackend: Got familiar with Nest.js, its decorators, and architecture. It was easy to adapt to since it resembled Express. I implemented microservices for time blocks and tasks, following the BFF principle.\n\nI explored Prisma for PostgreSQL interactions, which I found to be the most convenient tool I've used so far.",
    "home.workHistory.TaskSync.text4": "The most challenging part was implementing JWT authorization, as it was my first time using this approach. I wrote an endpoint that refreshes and creates new tokens, then sends them to the frontend via cookies.",
